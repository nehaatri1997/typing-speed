# typing-speed

This Python project is a simple typing speed test. It calculates your typing speed in words per minute (WPM) by measuring how quickly you type a given sentence or paragraph. This script provides a way to practice and improve typing speed and accuracy.

# Features

Measures typing speed in words per minute (WPM).
Tracks the accuracy of typing by comparing typed text to a reference sentence.
Provides feedback on typing speed and accuracy.
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. 

# Installation

Clone the repository or download the typing_speed_.py file.
(Optional) Set up a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.
Install any required dependencies. If the file requires specific libraries not in standard Python, install them.

# Usage
Run the script to start the typing speed test:
python typing_speed_.py

Follow the on-screen instructions to begin the test. Type the displayed text as quickly and accurately as possible.
After completing the typing test, your typing speed and accuracy will be displayed.

# Code Structure

Input Section: Displays a sentence for the user to type and starts timing as soon as they begin typing.
Calculation Section: Measures the typing speed in WPM and calculates accuracy by comparing user input to the target text.
Output Section: Displays the results, including WPM and accuracy percentage.
